StarSys is a project which contains:

1. A deep study of the operating system(linux)
2. Template of deep modified code
3. Performance optimization
4. The possible tecknowledge of the next genaraion.

Most of the motivations and ideas come from my daily work in IaaS,
which can be used to solve the practical problem.
